The following is a rough outline for the project:

1. Draw maze:
	The method for drawing the maze will be as follows:
	-Define a tile size that produces a 16x16 grid for the current canvas size (512x512 canvas gives 32x32 pixel tile). 
	-Fill the 2d array with either 0s or 1s. 0 = barrier, 1 = p-set (collectable). Othe numbers will later 
	represent special tokens like power ups etc. 
	Want to create multiple configurations or a way to randomize the config. can use for different levels
	We will then be able to traverse through the array and determine where to stop / where to increment the points when 
	p-set is collected. (sort of serves as a track for Penn-Man to follow)
2. We will then have to define the various objects, TA's, Penn-Man, Prof, and there corresponding movement speeds and
	abilties
	2.1 We will need to simulate the objects movement in a realistic way. Cna create difficulty levels for oponnents
3. Create persistence for pause game or storing user scores
4. Create main menu
5. Refractor code
